= Releasing process

[source,bash]
----
# local release branch tracks upstream/release
git checkout release
git pull upstream release

# merge master
git merge upstream/master

# release.sh will build with grunt and proceed with bumping
./release.sh

# check log...
git log --name-only
# ... you should only have files in "dist", package.json and plugin.json
# Last commit must be "Release vX.Y.Z", and previous must be master's merge commit. No more.

# finally, push to remote
git push upstream HEAD:release
git push upstream --tags
----

Some stuff to keep in mind:

- Never commit any code to release. Only allowed commits are master's merge, grunt bump and plugin.json update.
- Never pull or rebase release back to master. The commit tagged "ReleaseT0" should never appear on master.
